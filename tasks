1. Data Cleaning (if any)
2. EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis):
  - Descriptive statistics for each variable (include graphs)
  - Distribution of the response variable
  - Relation between explanatory variables and the response variables (and other covariates)
3. Model Selection & Validation:
  - Which covariates included? Which are not?
  - Interactions?
  - Other non-linear function considerations, e.g. polynomials?
4. Model Diagnostics:
  - Violations of regression assumptions?
  - Influential data points and/or outliers?
