Read the file:

```{r}
library(readxl)

# the excel sheet represents NA values by "NA"
brownfat <- read_excel("./description/BrownFat.xls", na = "NA")
nrow(brownfat)
```

Check if there's any NA values:

```{r}
x <- colSums(is.na(brownfat)) # 
x[x > 0]
```

3 variables has NA values detected: Cancer_Status, Cancer_Type, and TSH. Data cleaning needed.

Notice that $4425$ out of $n=4842$ observations had no data on their `TSH`, as this ratio is too large in order for us to confidently assign the most-probable values, we will choose to exclude the variable `TSH` altogether.

There are observations where both the `Cancer_Status` and `Cancer_Type` is set to NA, we will exclude these observations.
